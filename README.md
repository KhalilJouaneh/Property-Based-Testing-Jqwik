## Software
I used Jqwik, which is an alternative test engine for the JUnit 5 platform that
brings property-based testing (PBT) to Java.
[Jqwik's web site](https://jqwik.net/) contains a detailed, example-based
[user guide](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html), as well as
pointers to introductory material to PBT in general.


## Learning Outcomes
The purpose of this assignment is to give you
- practical experience with
    - identifying and expressing properties of the input and output of methods, and using these properties for testing and debugging
    - automatic test input generation
- an increased, practical understanding of implementing advanced data structures in Java with generics.
