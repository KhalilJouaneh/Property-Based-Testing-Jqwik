## Software
Used Jqwik, an alternative test engine for the JUnit 5 platform that
brings property-based testing (PBT) to Java.
[Jqwik's web site](https://jqwik.net/) contains a detailed, example-based
[user guide](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html), as well as
pointers to introductory material to PBT in general.
The latest version of Jqwik is available in the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:net.jqwik)
and the source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik).
Both Gradle and Maven provide support for JUnit, and thus also for Jqwik.
The starter code for this assignment contains a `gradle.build` file
suitable building and testing Java applications with Jqwik.


## Learning Outcomes
The purpose of this assignment is to give you
- practical experience with
    - identifying and expressing properties of the input and output of methods, and using these properties for testing and debugging
    - automatic test input generation
- an increased, practical understanding of implementing advanced data structures in Java with generics.
